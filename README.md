# The Landing Page

#### Description:
This is a project under the curriculum of The Odin Project, with the purpose to practice the fundamental concepts and mechanism of HTML and CSS, especially with the utilization of flexbox. I blended the theme of Hong Kong artist Hins Cheung in this page, with his recent concert in Singapore, to make it seem like a concert ticket purchase page!


#### Tools:
HTML, CSS
